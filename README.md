This web-based system is used to diagnose skin diseases. This system was built using a programming language are PHP native with the MVC method, HTML, CSS, Javascript and using a DBMS is MySQL.

In diagnosing skin diseases, this system uses the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach, the Minkowski distance method and the Bayesian indexing model. CBR is a reasoning system that uses old cases to solve new problems by comparing the level of similarity or similarity values. The minkowski distance method is used to calculate the similarity value between the old case and the new problem. Bayesian indexing model is used to improve the performance of the CBR.

This system was tested using k-fold cross validation with k=10 and threshold 80%. From the results of the tests carried out, it produced an accuracy of 89.719%.
